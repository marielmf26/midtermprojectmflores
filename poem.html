<h1>A Valentine</h1>
<h2>Edgar Allan Poe, 1809-1849</h2>


<p>For her this rhyme is penned, whose luminous eyes,</br>
Brightly expressive as the twins of Loeda,</br>
Shall find her own sweet name, that, nestling lies</br>
Upon the page, enwrapped from every reader.</br>
Search narrowly the lines!—they hold a treasure</br>
Divine—a talisman—an amuletv</br>
That must be worn at heart. Search well the measure—</br>
The words—the syllables! Do not forget</br>
The trivialest point, or you may lose your labor!</br>
And yet there is in this no Gordian knot</br>
Which one might not undo without a sabre,</br>
If one could merely comprehend the plot.</br>
Enwritten upon the leaf where now are peering</br>
Eyes scintillating soul, there lie perdus</br>
Three eloquent words oft uttered in the hearing</br>
Of poets, by poets—as the name is a poet’s, too.</br>
Its letters, although naturally lying</br>
Like the knight Pinto—Mendez Ferdinando—</br>
Still form a synonym for Truth—Cease trying!</br>
You will not read the riddle, though you do the best you can do.</p>
